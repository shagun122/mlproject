## Student Performance Prediction System

### Project Overview:
An end-to-end machine learning project that predicts student performance based on various factors like attendance, study hours, and past academic records. The system is integrated with a Flask web application for user interaction, allowing users to input data and get performance predictions.

### Technologies Used:
+ Machine Learning: Python, scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
+ Web Framework: Flask
+ Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
+ Frontend: HTML, CSS (for basic UI)

### Main Features:
+ User Interaction: A Flask-based web app that allows users to input student details (e.g., study hours, attendance) and get performance predictions.
+ Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, data normalization, and feature encoding to prepare data for modeling.
+ Model Building: Various machine learning models (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest, Logistic Regression,SVM,Boosting ,Bagging) are trained to predict student performance.
+ Real-Time Prediction: Users can interact with the app and input data to get real-time predictions on student performance.
+ Model Evaluation: Evaluates the models using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix for performance analysis.
+ Visualization: Displays relevant data visualizations like scatter plots, histograms, and performance metrics for better understanding.

### Steps to Run the Application:
+ Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/shagun122/Student_Performance_Predication_System.git
+ Install required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
+ Start the Flask app:
python app.py
+ Open a browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to interact with the application.
